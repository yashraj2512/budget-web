    <h6>Vibrant Villages Programme</h6>
•	Border villages with sparse population, limited connectivity and infrastructure often get left out from the development gains. Such villages on the northern border will be covered under the new Vibrant Villages Programme. The activities will include construction of village infrastructure, housing, tourist centres, road connectivity, provisioning of decentralized renewable energy, direct to home access for Doordarshan and educational channels, and support for livelihood generation. Additional funding for these activities will be provided. Existing schemes will be converged. We will define their outcomes and monitor them on a constant basis. <hr>
<h6>Housing for All</h6>
•	In 2022-23 80 lakh houses will be completed for the identified eligible beneficiaries of PM Awas Yojana, both rural and urban. ` 48,000 crore is allocated for this purpose. 56. The Central Government will work with the state governments for reduction of time required for all land and construction related approvals, for promoting affordable housing for middle class and Economically Weaker.  <br> 
•	To enable affordable broadband and mobile service proliferation in rural and remote areas, five per cent of annual collections under the Universal Service Obligation Fund will be allocated. This will promote R&D and commercialization of technologies and solutions. vision is that all villages and their residents should have the same access to e-services, communication facilities, and digital resources as urban areas and their residents. The contracts for laying optical fibre in all villages, including remote areas, will be awarded under the Bharatnet project through PPP in 2022-23. Completion is expected in 2025. Measures will be taken to enable better and more efficient use of the optical fibre. <hr>

<h6>Reduced Alternate minimum tax rate and Surcharge for Cooperatives</h6> 
•Currently, cooperative societies are required to pay Alternate Minimum Tax at the rate of eighteen and one half per cent. However, companies pay the same at the rate of fifteen per cent. proposal to reduce this rate for the cooperative societies also to fifteen per cent.
Also propose to reduce the surcharge on co-operative societies from present 12 per cent to 7 per cent for those having total income of more than ` 1 crore and up to ` 10 crores. This would help in enhancing the income of cooperative societies and its members who are mostly from rural and farming communities.
