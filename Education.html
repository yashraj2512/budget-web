    <h6>	Universalization of Quality Education</h6>
    •Due to the pandemic-induced closure of schools, our children, particularly in the rural areas, and those from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, and other weaker sections, have lost almost 2 years of formal education. Mostly, these are children in government schools. We recognise the need to impart supplementary teaching and to build a resilient mechanism for education delivery. For this purpose, ‘one class-one TV channel’ programme of PM eVIDYA will be expanded from 12 to 200 TV channels. This will enable all states to provide supplementary education in regional languages for classes 1-12. <br>
    In vocational courses, to promote crucial critical thinking skills, to give space for creativity, 750 virtual labs in science and mathematics, and 75 skilling e-labs for simulated learning environment, will be set-up in 2022-23. <br> 
    High-quality e-content in all spoken languages will be developed for delivery via internet, mobile phones, TV and radio through Digital Teachers. <br> 
    A competitive mechanism for development of quality e-content by the teachers will be set-up to empower and equip them with digital tools of teaching and facilitate better learning outcomes. <br>

  <h6>Digital University</h6>
</div>
  •	A Digital University will be established to provide access to students across the country for world-class quality universal education with personalised learning experience at their doorsteps. This will be made available in different Indian languages and ICT formats. The University will be built on a networked hub-spoke model, with the hub building cutting edge ICT expertise. The best public universities and institutions in the country will collaborate as a network of hub-spokes. <br>
  • Presenting the Union Budget 2022, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the formation of a digital university to provide access to world-class education to Indian students. The budget this year also focused on digital learning citing the prolonged closure of schools impacting students’ academic performance. <br>
  • The minister also announced that the digital university will impart lessons in all regional languages creating a network of ‘hub and spoke’. The university will work with the other central universities in the country to provide the required digital infrastructure and training. <br> 
  •  The government has also laid focus on agri education. The finance minister stressed to revise syllabi of agricultural universities to meet needs of natural, zero-budget & organic farming, modern-day agriculture. <br>

  • Meanwhile, the government has decided to allow the setting up of foreign universities in the Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT city) to provide courses in financial management, fin-tech, mathematics among others. <br> 
  •The goal behind this initiative, which is open for the citizens of the country, is to skill, upskill or reskill. It will also provide API-based trusted skill credentials, payment and discovery layers to find relevant jobs and entrepreneurial opportunities. <br>
  •A National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF) will also be aligned with the industry dynamic to promote continuous skilling avenues, sustainability, and employability. <br>
  •She further added that a TV channel named ‘e-Vidya’, will also be implemented to provide supplementary education to children from class 1 to 12, especially for children in rural areas, to make up for the loss of the learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. <br>
